# Productivity App
*A minimalistic Flutter-based productivity app for managing academic and personal tasks*

## Overview
This is a cross-platform productivity application built using **Flutter**.
The app helps users organize and track tasks across four categories: **Assignments, Homework, Projects, and Meetings**. Each category allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks, with data persisted locally on the device.

This project was created as part of my early exploration into mobile app development using Flutter and Dart.

## Features
- Category-based task management (Assignments, Homework, Projects, Meetings)
- Add new tasks via dialog input
- Mark tasks as completed with checkboxes
- Swipe-to-delete tasks using dismissible list items
- Local data persistence using SharedPreferences
- Clean, color-coded UI with custom icons
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **State Management:** Stateful Widgets
- **Local Storage:** SharedPreferences
- **UI Components:** Material & Cupertino widgets
- **Platforms:** Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux

## What I Learned
- Building multi-page Flutter apps 
- Designing responsive layouts
- Managing state with `StatefulWidget`
- Implementing persistent local storage using `SharedPreferences`
- Handling user interactions (dialogs, gestures, swipe actions)
- Structuring Flutter projects for cross-platform deployment
- Creating reusable UI components (custom buttons)

## Acknowledgements
- Flutter & Dart documentation
- Open-source Flutter community
- Icons and UI inspiration from personal design experiments
